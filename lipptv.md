      LIPP TV was the final performance project of the Live Image Processing and Performance (LIPP) class at NYU ITP. LIPP TV is a creative response to how code, video networks, and art can be used to create a new experience in live performance. Each student has created their own short TV show influenced by video art, experimental animation, public access TV, and more.<br/><br/>
