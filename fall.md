    Fall (I Fell in Love with my Avatar) is a real-time, non-interactive simulation which romanticizes the simpler life of a virtual being in a post-capitalist internet. In a deserted digital backyard, a bohemian half-cat, half-human avatar is stuck riding on a swing, while coping with feelings of joy, exhaustion and frustration. As you witness her perpetual swinging, a short letter unfolds.<br/><br/>
