    Greetings âœ¨ <br/><br/>
    This page is part of my submission for the Arab Bank Emerging Artist prize.<br/><br/>
    World Upstream is a real-time simulation of infinite duration, which exists as a <i>.exe software</i>. Since this file format was not an option in the submission form, I'm adding a few resources here.
    <br/><br/>
    <u>Video Documentation</u><br/>
    On the right side you can watch a 3 minute long trailer of the project, as well as two screen recordings of the simulation: a short one (7 minutes) and a long one (3 hours and 19 minutes.) 
    <br/><br/>

    <u>The Software</u><br/>
    You can download the simulation <a href="https://worldupstream.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/WU-1.0.0-v3.zip" target="_blank">here</a>. The software only runs on Windows and requires a dedicated, recent graphics card (NVIDIA RTX 3060 or equivalent,) a standard gaming setup.
    <br/><br/>

    <u>Other Materials</u><br/>
    You can find a PDF presentation of the work <a href="/assets/media/WorldUpstream-Presentation-Fall24.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/><br/>

    <u>A note on minting</u><br/>
    While I've minted other works from this series as NFTs, I haven't done it for the core simulation. I'm excited to find a way for software like this to meaningfully exist as an NFT. Currently the work exists in the contemporary art market, as an edition of 3 + 2AP.
    <br/><br/>
    Thank you for your consideration,<br/>
    c

    The 3h19 recording of the simulation is currently on view on <a href="https://down-the-silicon-meadow.common.garden/">common.garden</a>, part of Down the Silicon Meadow, an exhibition curated by OFFICE IMPART and Blueshift Gallery.
