     <em>How do we bring locality back into our networks?</em> is the prompt this project offers a non realistic answer to. While most social networking technologies work towards maximizing screen time, An Algorithm That Gives You 4 Friends does the opposite: it sends you back to the real world, and asks you to sit in silence with a group of peers.

     The project is designed as a series of 8 prompts and meant to be experienced by 5 people with 5 computers, sitting in the same room. It creates a user unfriendly back and forth between digital and physical interactions, with the goal of creating a community where there was not one before.
