     During a visit at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in 2019, I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.careyyoung.com/declared-void-2" target="__blank">Declared Void II</a> (Carey Young, 2013) â€“ a piece which really spoke to my identity as an immigrant. <em>Declared Void II</em> invites the viewer to step into an enclosed area, delimited by black tape, with a wall text that reads: <em>By entering the zone created by this drawing, and for the period you remain there, you declare and agree that you are a citizen of the United States of America</em>.<br/><br/>

     Decades ago, web enthusiasts claimed that the internet transcends notions of citizenship (e.g. John Perry Barlow's now quite dated <em>A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</em>.) Today, we understand that not to be the case. Even though we are presented with the idea of an ethereal <em>cloud</em> which is home to all our digital belongings, the infrastructure of the internet is very much physical and embedded in national sovereignty.<br/><br/>

     <em>declared vvvvvvoid</em> engages with the politicized roots of the cloud. It is a browser extension which reminds the user of the land each website she visits is hosted on, through two gestures: first, a square dialog which appears when the site loads invites the viewer to become a citizen of the country where the page is hosted, by placing her cursor inside of a square; second, satellite and Street View imagery of the server's physical location are revealed on top of the website's content when the user is inactive for a period of time, creating a collage of the land the site is hosted on.
