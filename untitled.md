    Untitled (Computer Mouse Experiment #1) is an exercise in using the computer mouse gently. Through using the interactive video format, I give each viewer the illusion of control—wherever they move the mouse, my on-screen body follows the cursor slowly, and eventually catches up with it.

    In its current form, Untitled talks about the too-abstracted-away direct relationship between (our) mouse gestures and (someone else’s) human labor. At the same time, it is a simple algorithm applied to my own body—two nested <em>for</em> loops, on a 4 x 8 matrix. An exhaustive walk which turns the body into a worker.
