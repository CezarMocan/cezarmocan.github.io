    Untitled (Computer Mouse Experiment #1) is an exercise in using the computer mouse gently. Through using the interactive video format, I give each viewer the illusion of control—wherever they move the mouse, my on-screen body follows the cursor slowly, and eventually catches up with it.

    In its current form, Untitled talks about the hidden relationship between our mouse gestures and someone else’s physical labor. At the same time, it is a simple algorithm applied to my own body—two nested <em>for</em> loops, on a 4 x 8 matrix. An exhaustive walk which turns the body into a worker.
