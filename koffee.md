     Where do a place and a typeface meet? This two-sided poster is meant to function as both an abstracted representation of a space and as a type specimen. The pair used is Koffee, a wonderful coffee shop in New Haven, and Storno, a whimsical typeface by the Lineto foundry.

     The print is foldable, such that the back of the poster functions as a 4-spread booklet, containing a menu of the coffeeshop—presenting the drinks, and a menu of the typeface—showcasing its characters.

     This poster was created as part of Yale’s Typography II studio.
