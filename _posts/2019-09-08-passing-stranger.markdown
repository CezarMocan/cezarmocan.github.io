[*Passing Stranger*](http://eastvillagepoetrywalk.org/){:class="underlined"} is an hour and a half long audio tour of the East Village, framed through the life stories and work of artists who have emerged and lived in the neighborhood during the second half of the 20th century. Curated by the Danish poet *Pejk Malinovski* and narrated by filmmaker *Jim Jarmusch*, the sound walk truly acts as a time portal to a less gentrified and more politically radical East Village, home to characters such as Allen Ginsberg, Patti Smith or The Velvet Underground. Having previously spent some time in the neighborhood (but never enough to know it intimately,) the tour was the perfect opportunity to

The walk starts at the cross of E10th Street and 2nd Ave, in front of the St. Mark's Church-In-The-Bowery—one of the oldest religious sites in the city, also a culture hub of the neighborhood, since the beginning of the 1900s. It's beautiful that one of the oldest places in the city, especially one associated with religious practice, opened its doors to the local creatives, misfits, punks and to the opressed. 



Where do we start and how? —St Marks' church; political activism;
we pass by Tompkins Square Park, Allen Ginsberg's old apartment at 437 East 12th Street, Frank O'Hara's old apartment at 441 East 9th Street, each stop including a montage of historical and political context, poetry, interviews and recordings from the time.

Dial-a-poem: early new media art, which ended up being so widely used! 

Format: Refreshing to have a low-tech "mixed reality" experience. It's truly engaging, while not being too intrusive on the neighborhood. It makes you look, really look, at the streets and people.
Just using simple headphones --> the experience of hearing the tour and the neighborhood together
