1—I have been fascinated with clocks and their sound since childhood, and have been thinking of building my own for a while. This direction involves creating a sound installation out of multiple clocks (between 9 and 20 of them, arranged in a grid.) I am interested in creating polyrhythms out of their mechanical movement, while also giving the viewer the illusion of control over how fast / slow time is passing in different clocks. All clocks would tick at the exact minute, but for the 60 seconds in between minutes the rhythm of each clock is adjustable.

2—I am a huge fan of <a href="https://www.zimoun.net/" target="__blank" class="underlined">Zimoun's</a> sound sculpture work. This direction involves creating a urban landscape inspired percussive instrument using a series of motors and the materials used in city environments: concrete, rubber, steel. 

3—A self-portrait interactive sculpture, where different components represent different parts of my body. Different parts would make use of LEDs, an LCD screen, speakers and sensors in order to create different interactions and represent their respective body part differently.
