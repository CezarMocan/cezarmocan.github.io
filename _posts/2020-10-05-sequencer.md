I continued working with my Daz character, and took last week's investigations around repetition, body parts, textures and close-ups one step further. At the same time, I've wanted to make a digital character cry for some months now, so I spent a good amount of time figuring out how to apply tears on the avatar's skin. I had this very specific animated & over the top tear in mind from a Mika Rottenberg piece, but I can't find it anymore... I think the tears I ended up making are somewhat close to what I was going for, 70% realistic and 30% obviously over the top, but they could use a lot of work. The whole video is going all in and beyond on the d33p sadness of the track I chose & of the character. I ended up shooting individual scenes in the Sequencer, and editing them together (with sound as well) in Premiere.
