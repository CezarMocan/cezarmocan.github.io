For the physical computing midterm project I worked in collaboration with Keunjung Bae. The assignment was Halloween themed, so we decided to build a device that allows one to search for the spirits stuck between worlds. Inspired by technology used by the ghost hunting communities (namely <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Ghost_box" target="__blanl" class="underlined">ghost boxes</a>,) we came up with our own interface for finding ghosts.

We chose a dark, mysterious look for the box, so we chose glossy acrylic as the main fabrication material. Using the illusion technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper%27s_ghost" target="__blank" class="underlined">Pepper's Ghost</a> (so many ghosts!,) we display a visualization of the spirit search frequency spectrum as a hologram on the box screen.

Using a knob, the user explores the frequency spectrum and, eventually, reaches a few spirits.

Sonically, the white noise sounds coming out of the box are produced by an <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Wireless/General/TEA5767.pdf" target="__blank" class="underlined">FM Radio Receiver</a> which jumps between different frequencies a few times a second.
