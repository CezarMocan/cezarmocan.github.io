Doing a 3D scan proved to be a lot of fun, my partner and I scanned each other a few times (and also considered scanning Lentil the cat, but quickly gave up on that :) ). However the results did not turn out great, mostly due to my being stubborn in deciding to use a Microsoft Kinect 2 (the XBox One version) I own, instead of a structure sensor from the ER. 

It turns out the Skanect software developers had decided not to implement support for this version of the Kinect, due to its poor results in scanning. I ended up using the default Windows 3D Scan app, which worked well. My scan's mesh turned out fine â€“ low-ish resolution, but not bad overall, and it can probably be smoothed out a bit in Maya. However, the texture has a large amount of visual glitches all over the place, aside from the poor image quality (which I was expecting.)

I'm not quite sure whether the texture quality is a matter of hardware or software, but I assume it's something I could entirely avoid by using equipment from the ER. I might do that this coming week, in order to work with a higher quality scan of myself.

However, I find the texture file (glitchy as it is) to be quite gorgeous!
