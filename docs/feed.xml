Throughout the 1990s, the MTA slowly moved into a new Manhattan headquarters, leaving the 370 Jay building partially empty and unproperly maintained. Once regarded as a landmark of modernism in Brooklyn, the building fell into decay until 2012, when New York University acquired it, expanding its Brooklyn campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of format, our sound walk is quite similar to an informative podcast: a narrator (❤️ Russell) guides the listener through the building’s history, while the listener makes their way from the 4th floor of the building towards the subway stop across the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of process, we started out by doing a session of sound recording throughout the building, before really knowing what topic we were going to focus on. We recorded a few samples of background noise on the ITP floor, elevator sounds, door sounds, footsteps, construction noise. While we ended up using very few of the samples recorded in this first session, it helped us get familiar with the recording equipment and explore the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we had a collection of the building’s environmental sounds, we split up and individually researched the history of the building (which has a pretty extensive &lt;a class=&quot;underlined&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/370_Jay_Street&quot; target=&quot;__blank&quot;&gt;Wikipedia entry&lt;/a&gt;.) The story we wanted to tell emerged from our conversations around the building’s history, and the fascination with the fact that both the MTA and ITP are truly dynamic entities, aiming to move people and ideas. We took it to the whiteboard in order to come up with a structure for the audio piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2019-09-23-soundwalk-reflection/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Whiteboard brainstorming session&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After deciding on the four main sections of the story (ITP, MTA, the dollar van and ITP again), we wrote a script and recorded Russell narrating it, using the ZOOM field recorder and a shotgun mic. The recording process was smooth—we captured two takes for each section, which proved to be more than enough during the editing phase. Nothing needed re-recording.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once recording the narration was complete, we cleaned up the audio files in Adobe Audition (mainly trimming and noise removal) and edited together the backbone of our sound walk—the narration from start to finish. During the editing phase, we kept going back and forth between researching sound effects and music tracks for different segments of our piece, and adjusting the timing of each chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2019-09-23-soundwalk-reflection/3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Part of our soundwalk's Adobe Audition timeline&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After exporting our first rough cut, we started mapping the sound to the moving through space, and iterated on timing until the walking pace felt right. We were initially planning on having the walk start on the 4th floor of 370 Jay, go down in the subway station and end in the lobby of our building, but this was too ambitions: it would have taken way more than 5 minutes. We ended up reducing the scope of the walk—start on 4th floor, end outside the subwya stop—, and still had to stretch the audio content in order to account for slow walking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back on the process and outcome, I am happy with how our sound walk turned out. The collaboration felt natural, as we complemented each other well and brought different perspectives and skills to the table. One mistake I believe we’ve made is that we started thinking about mapping sound to the space very late in the process. Given that a sound walk is a site specific audio piece, I believe we should have considered movement way earlier during our ideation, instead of retro-fitting it on our first audio export. It would have also been a good idea to add more audio clues to signify the space one is in, and potentially have audio directions instead of written instructions. Regardless—working on this piece was a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="CommLab: Video &amp; Sound" /><category term="ITP" /><summary type="html">For the first CL: Video &amp;amp; Sound assignment, Russell and I worked on a sound walk of 370 Jay Street, focused on creating a narrative arc for the evolution of the building’s usage from the 1950s until today. 370 Jay St. was erected as a headquarters for New York’s Transit Authority (the MTA) in the 1950s, and served that function for more than 40 years.

This involved learning how to use a multimeter—for checking continuity or measuring resistance, voltage, and amperage—as well as creating a few basic circuits, involving a power supply, resistors and LEDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a next step, we introduced a switch into the circuit, while also playing with more LEDs, in series or in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;video class=&quot;img-row-2&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2019-09-17-led-switch/5.mov&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; muted=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Pressing the switch lights up the two LEDs.&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also introduced a potentiometer into the setup, as a way to manually adjust the resistance of the circuit and the voltage that gets to our LEDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;video src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2019-09-17-led-switch/7.mov&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; muted=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Turning the potentiometer's knob adjusts the brightness of the LEDs.&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last part of the assignment involved building a creative switch for our LEDs—one that is not neccesarily a push button, or an existing interface. I was interested in having the LEDs light up when a sound (or rather noise) event is happening, so I came up with this silly contraption. It uses conductive thread to attach the moving piece to the tilted metal rod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0:00—Begin on the 4th floor at 370 Jay Street in front of the Wooden Mirror;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0:13—Proceed to the right and then to the left through the glass doors, passing the ping pong table. Walk past the Equipment Room and the Shop, towards the kitchen. Take a right in the kitchen, and another right on the hallway. Then, walk down the hallway, towards the elevator bank;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2:10—Proceed down Stair D to your left down to the 1st floor;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3:05—Stop briefly at the “Transportation Building” plaque on the first floor;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3:20—Proceed to exit the building. Once outside of the building, cross the street towards Myrtle Ave. and stop at the MTA entrance. When you get there, turn around and look at 370 Jay. The soundwalk ends here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Curated by the Danish poet &lt;em&gt;Pejk Malinovski&lt;/em&gt; and narrated by filmmaker &lt;em&gt;Jim Jarmusch&lt;/em&gt;, the sound walk truly acts as a time portal to a less gentrified and more politically radical East Village, home to characters such as Allen Ginsberg, Patti Smith or The Velvet Underground. Having previously spent some time in the neighborhood, but never enough to know it intimately, the tour was a perfect opportunity to strenghten my friendship with the village’s streets and landmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The walk starts at the cross of E10th Street and 2nd Ave, in front of the St. Mark’s Church-In-The-Bowery—one of the oldest religious sites in the city, also a culture hub of the neighborhood since the beginning of the 1900s. Poets would host readings here and politically progressive groups would gather in this space, and I find it beautiful that one of the oldest places in the city, especially one associated with religious practice, opened its doors to the local creatives, misfits, punks and to the opressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We proceed north on 2nd Ave then head east on East 12th Street, while learning about the opera influences in Walt Whitman’s poetry, passing Allen Ginsberg’s old apartment at 437 East 12th, and becoming familiar with Jon Giorno’s &lt;em&gt;Dial-a-poem&lt;/em&gt; project. I want to stop here for a second, as this is an incredible work of early new media art, which uses a few telephones and a few tape players as a means to making poetry accessible to a wide audience, while creating a radical space and sharing it with the world. MoMA and The New Museum have included &lt;em&gt;Dial-a-poem&lt;/em&gt; in a few shows recently, meaning that there is at least one active phone number that is running the project. Try it yourself: 641-793-8122.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of structure, the audio tour is split up into 30 different locations, each accompanied by a short episode. Every episode is a montage of narration which gives historical and political context, old recordings of poetry readings, interviews and music. There isn’t much in terms of sound effects or a rich soundtrack to accompany the voices speaking to us—that role is left open for Lower East Side’s streets live soundscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2019-09-08-passing-stranger/frank_ohara.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Plaque at Frank O'Hara's old apartment at 441 East 9th Street&quot; /&gt;

    Image description: A bronze plaque on the building where Frank O'Hara used to live. The text reads: &lt;em&gt;Frank O'Hara (1926—1966). The influential American poet Frank O'Hara lived at 441 East 9th Street from 1959 to 1963. O'Hara was a leading member of the New York School of poetry as well as an accomplished art critic and curator at the Museum of Modern Art. Downtown people and places figure prominently in his buoyant books, especially his circle of noted writers and painters who have been called &quot;the last avant garde&quot;. Placed by the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation with the generous support of the Two Boots Foundation.&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, in addition to the beautifully curated content, it felt refreshing to participate in this “mixed reality” experience in a low-tech way—with simple earbuds, which allowed for the street sounds to merge with Jim Jarmusch’s narration, without a computerized GPS voice in my ears suggesting when to turn left and right, or without an augmented reality layer to bring the space to life, digitally. The audio was truly engaging, and the necessity of being proactive in finding my way to the different locations contributed to the sense that I am discovering a new place and a new time.&lt;/p&gt;
