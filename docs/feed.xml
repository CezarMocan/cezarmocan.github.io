This direction involves creating a sound installation out of multiple clocks (between 9 and 20 of them, arranged in a grid.) I am interested in creating polyrhythms out of their mechanical movement, while also giving the viewer the illusion of control over how fast / slow time is passing in different clocks. All clocks would tick at the exact minute, but for the 60 seconds in between minutes the rhythm of each clock is adjustable.&lt;/p&gt;

This direction involves creating a urban landscape inspired percussive instrument using a series of motors and the materials used in city environments: concrete, rubber, steel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3—A self-portrait interactive sculpture, where different components represent different parts of my body. Different parts would make use of LEDs, an LCD screen, speakers and sensors in order to create different interactions and represent their respective body part differently.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the physical computing midterm project I worked in collaboration with Keunjung Bae. The assignment was Halloween themed, so we decided to build a device that allows one to search for the spirits stuck between worlds. Inspired by technology used by the ghost hunting communities (namely &lt;a href=&quot;https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Ghost_box&quot; target=&quot;__blanl&quot; class=&quot;underlined&quot;&gt;ghost boxes&lt;/a&gt;,) we came up with our own interface for finding ghosts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2019-11-01-ghost-box/3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ghost box side view, with headphones attached.&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We chose a dark, mysterious look for the box, so we chose glossy acrylic as the main fabrication material. Using the illusion technique called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper%27s_ghost&quot; target=&quot;__blank&quot; class=&quot;underlined&quot;&gt;Pepper’s Ghost&lt;/a&gt; (so many ghosts!,) we display a visualization of the spirit search frequency spectrum as a hologram on the box screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sonically, the white noise sounds coming out of the box are produced by an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Wireless/General/TEA5767.pdf&quot; target=&quot;__blank&quot; class=&quot;underlined&quot;&gt;FM Radio Receiver&lt;/a&gt; which jumps between different frequencies a few times a second.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first weekly assignment for &lt;a class=&quot;underlined&quot; target=&quot;__blank&quot; href=&quot;https://itp.nyu.edu/fab/&quot;&gt;Intro to Fabrication&lt;/a&gt; involves building a flashlight.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From early on I was interested in building a user unfriendly flashlight—one which only lights up when a collection of switches is in a certain configuration. While also thinking about Ben’s story behind this assignment, I decided that the magic configuration which would turn on the flash light should be the birthday of someone close from my family—September 26th, 1966.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;img-row-2&quot; style=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2019-10-30-flashlight/0.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Early sketch.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Early sketch.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am using the binary representation of the day, month and year in order to spell out this particular date using switches, as follows: on the first row, we have 5 bits for the day (since days are between 1 and 31). On the second row, we have 4 bits for the month (between 1 and 12). On the third row, we have 7 bits for the last two digits of the year (between 0 and 99.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;img-row-2&quot; style=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2019-10-30-flashlight/1.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;All 6 faces of the flash light after being laser cut.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    All 6 faces of the flash light after being laser cut.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flashlight is a simple box, with switches on one side, and 5 LEDs on a different side. In terms of materials, I went for plywood. The fabrication process involved using the laser cutter in order to get the box faces, soldering for the electric circuit and a messy hot glue gun to bring everything together.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mirror Room is an installation built in collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rachelqxl.space&quot; class=&quot;underlined&quot;&gt;Rachel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shuyichang.com/&quot; class=&quot;underlined&quot;&gt;Shuyi&lt;/a&gt; in response to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nether&quot; class=&quot;underlined&quot;&gt;The Nether&lt;/a&gt;—a sci-fi play talking about avatars, emotional attachment and pedophillia (yes, it’s complicated…).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concept&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set in a near future in which the internet has become more immersive, the play approaches a number of dualities pertaining to a human existence split between a physical world and a digital one. Our group chose to focus on the interrogation room scenes, happening between Detective Morris and Sims, while also approaching the interactions happening within &lt;em&gt;The Hideaway&lt;/em&gt;, an online space where anonymous adults with child avatars fulfill the fantasies of other anonymous adults with adult avatars. We wanted to create an environment similar to the interrogation room, limit access to the installation to two people concurrently, and funnel the communication between the two through a digital layer as a way of introducing a wall of anonimity between them. While the two participants would be sitting a few feet away from each other, they would not see each other’s faces, and their communication would happen through screens, mice, keyboards and text-to-speech software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main object we worked with for the installation is the mirror. Mirrors made sense for two reasons: first, the room we were installing in had glass walls, so everything felt  exposed and too transparent. We wanted to amplify this effect, since we were going for a sterile, interview-room aesthetic. Second, the mirror made sense conceptually in the context of online avatars and fulfilling forbidden desires—the online search for anonymous &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;, especially in a provider / consumer context, is an inherently selfish act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mirror idea came into the conversation early on, and over the course of the week we discussed how we could create a compelling experience using the mirrors, and tie them conceptually to avatars. I think as a team we were good at getting materials and prototyping early on (maybe not early enough though? see cube size issue below…), as well as spending time in the assigned space and trying ideas out as soon as we had them. I think we were also good at generating ideas for interactions inside the installation. What I wish we had done a better job at is staying aligned conceptually: taking a step back every now and then, and asking ourselves the high level questions (&lt;em&gt;Is X still what we want people experiencing this installation to feel?&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Why interaction X over interaction Y?&lt;/em&gt;, etc.) I also wish we could have put more thought into altering the space more significantly, but I’m blaming the short time for this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up hanging a mirror cube from the ceiling. Throughout the course of the entire experience, one of the two participants would be sitting in a chair while having their head covered by the cube. The second participant would also be sitting, facing the first participant’s body and their mirror head, with a laptop in front of them. Participant #1 asks Participant #2 questions from a list, using a mouse. Participant #2 hears text-to-speech synthesized readings of the questions and sees them on their screen, and answers by typing on their laptop. While the interaction is happening, an ambiental smooth jazz track is playing through the speakers, in an attempt to create a comfortable setting for the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ran into a few difficulties while installing and testing this setup, which could have probably been avoided through better planning. Hanging a cube from the ceiling proved to be a more difficult (or at least much slower) task than we had expected, which led to us not having enough time to hang 5 other surface mirrors from the ceiling, as we were planning. We wanted to create the experience of being lost in a handful of images of themselves for Participant #2, but didn’t manage to achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mirror cube’s size was 12in. x 12in. x 12in., a decision largely constrained by materials—we found plastic mirror sheets of that size (and wanted to avoid hanging glass mirrors from the ceiling because of their weight.) However, the cube had a small screen inside (smartphone size), and the person sitting inside needed to see the screen. Due to the small size of the cube, this part of the experience was uncomfortable and needs to be reworked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used four networked devices: a smartphone inside of the cube which Participant #1 would use to ask Participant #2 questions from a list, a laptop which Participant #2 would use to receive the questions and type answers, a second laptop which we used in order to allow Participant #1 to control the smartphone using a computer mouse, and a second smartphone which we used outside of the installation in order to control the progression of events in the room (playing a voiceover of the instructions once both participants are in, showing the list of questions or ending the experience.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;img-row-2&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2019-10-10-the-nether-installation/control-interface.png&quot; alt=&quot;Control interface on my mobile phone.&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there were no major difficulties in developing the software, Friday’s playtest session brought a few challenges: the smartphone screen going black after a certain amount of idle time, the networked communication not working for the first pair which tried the installation, or us having to listen closely and observe the room when controlling the experience from outside, because certain triggers had not been implemented. These are all technical challenges which could have been avoided with some more testing before showing the work, we were definitely rushed. The main learning here is to plan the install better next time, such that there is time for at least one full run-through before the show starts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This installation made for a busy week, but I’m happy with how it turned out. It’s ultimately a prototype for the idea of having two people share a physical space, and be led into having an intimate encounter exclusively digitally. The main question I want to ask participants is whether it made them willing to share more than they would have if they had been in the same room with a (semi-)stranger without the technological barriers we imposed. If yes, why and how?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week’s physical computing labs involved working with analog input and output for the Arduino, as well as soldering. Since we’re having a review week, I chose to focus on two things: 1) Improving the &lt;a class=&quot;underlined&quot; href=&quot;/2019/09/25/technology-observation.html&quot;&gt;LED sequencer I built for the previous lab;&lt;/a&gt; and 2) Getting outside of the breadboard and working with resin, a material I’ve wanted to experiment with for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sequencer 2.0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recap, last week the sequencer used 3 steps—3 LEDs, each blinking when the current step is playing a note, and 3 potentiometers, used to adjust the frequency of the note played at each step. It also included a 4th potentiometer which controlled the perceived “speed” of the sequencer—how much time is spent playing the note at each step. This week’s improvements included:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;adding a 4th step to the sequencer, in order to play slightly more complex sequences; ideally, we would have 8 or 16 steps, but real estate is limited on the breadboard;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;adding another control input to the sequencer in the form of a photoresistor; this allows for controlling the overall pitch of the played sequence by covering or uncovering the sensor with one’s hand;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;improving the software such that the Arduino &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt; cycle is not dependent on the speed of the sequencer anymore; this means that frequency of a step’s sound can now be adjusted while the step is playing;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;experimenting with different sensitivity levels for the photoresistor reading (I ended up settling on dividing the output into 8 different buckets, since the sensor readings were quite noisy.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the photoresistor in action:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was initially going for the theremin &lt;em&gt;continous bending&lt;/em&gt; sound quality, I realized that was going to be difficult for two main reasons: the noise in the photoresistor reading (even when averaged over time) and the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt; function timing trade-offs between &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tone&lt;/code&gt; working properly and proper responsivity. So I went a different direction and started working with only discrete quantities. As mentioned before, I divided the photoresistor output into only roughly 8 different buckets. In terms of the frequencies that get played by the sequencer, they all full octaves apart and have the C pitch (the step frequencies get rounded to multiples of 65.) This produces an effect similar to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;amp;q=quantizer&quot; target=&quot;__blank&quot; class=&quot;underlined&quot;&gt;quantizer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are two more videos of playing the sequencer. The noise in the photoresistor changes the pitch here and there, which adds an improvisation quality to the sound. I find this enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LED Resin Cube&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project came about out of a desire to use materials outside of the breadboard and practice soldering at the same time. I’ve been wanting to experiment with resin for some time, so I decided to build a small resin light. After purchasing supplies from Blick, I built a cube mold for the resin, using a 1/8in thick plastic sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;img-row-2&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2019-10-02-sensors-and-soldering/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Measuring and cutting out 5 faces of a cube.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got the 5 cube sides together using a glue gun, and poured the first layer of resin—about 0.75in thick. After letting it cure for about 8 hours, I added the 3 red LEDs and poured the second and last resin layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;img-row-2&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2019-10-02-sensors-and-soldering/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Adding the LEDs on top of the first resin layer.&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After letting the second layer cure overnight, the cube was ready to come out of its mold. I noticed that the top corners of the cube were not even with the rest of the surface. This might have to do with the resin curing process emanating heat, which might have interfered with the glue on the sides of my square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;img-row-3&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2019-10-02-sensors-and-soldering/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cured resin cube with bent corners.&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After removing all edges of the plastic mold, the resin cube looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can notice that the side which was exposed to air is fully transparent, while the sides that were enclosed by plastic have a layer of translucent material. After sanding the cube in order to get rid of the material excess at the edges and get a uniform look, I attacned six pins to the bottom and soldered together the even ones and the odd ones, as a way of having a single power source for the 3 LEDs. (in the ugliest soldering job the planet has seen.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After plugging in the cube, the LEDs (surprisingly?) lit up. The second failure of this project consisted in the fact that I was expecting the light to be way more diffuse, but instead the 3 LEDs are clear. This is due to the fact that most of the cube’s inner volume is fully transparent, so the problem could be solved by adding a small amount of white or silver paint in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will likely work with resin again, but next time I will choose a different material for the mold. Using plastic made the mold unusable after getting the resin out of it. 3d printing the positive shape, creating a silicone mold and pouring resin into that sounds like the right choice of materials and process for pretty much any (small scale) shape. To be continued.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A piece of public technology I get to observe and interact with daily is the crosswalk button at the intersection of Bushwick Ave. and Kosciuszko street. While Bushwick is known for being one of the latest additions to the gentrification train, we can rest assured that at least in terms of infrastructure, everything is older than most inhabitants of the neighborhood 🙃.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crosswalk button in front of my apartment building is no exception—it is probably one of the first iterations of this type of technology, built and placed on location likely before the digital era. The interface features a single circular metal button, slightly larger than the size of a thumb’s tip, placed at the bottom of a round metal panel. Due to usage over a long period of time, pressing the button requires a lot of force, as it tends to get stuck in a lifted position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of functionality, all I can say is that I am confused. I have lived here for a year and used the button multiple times per week. However, I don’t know whether it works or not. Every time after pressing the button, the pedestrian traffic light has turned green after a sensible amount of time. That is also true for every instance when I haven’t pressed the button. Since the interface itself has no way of providing visual, auditory or tactile feedback, all one can do is hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observing other people use the button has led to a similar conclusion. The general usage pattern seems to involve 1) noticing that there is a button after waiting at the traffic light for 5-10 seconds, 2) pressing it and looking slightly confused and 3) waiting for the pedestrian signal to turn green. When observing people interact with this interface, it’s relatively easy to spot the ones already familiar with it. They know the button is there, however they do not press it unless the pedestrian traffic light stays red for a frustrating amount of time (15 seconds and above.) Around the 15 second mark, pressing the button becomes a way of releasing built-up tension, or sending a signal to divinity. Fortunately, a response always comes back. We just don’t know when.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, for this week’s lab I have been playing with the speaker cone in our PComp kits and built a rudimentary 3-step sequencer using the Arduino as a controller. Each of the 3 LEDs represents one step in the sequence, and lights up for the duration of that step. The potentiometer (knob) associated with each LED controls the frequency of the sound played at the respective step. The 4th potentiometer controls the step duration (the three steps have equal durations.)&lt;/p&gt;

Throughout the 1990s, the MTA slowly moved into a new Manhattan headquarters, leaving the 370 Jay building partially empty and unproperly maintained. Once regarded as a landmark of modernism in Brooklyn, the building fell into decay until 2012, when New York University acquired it, expanding its Brooklyn campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of format, our sound walk is quite similar to an informative podcast: a narrator (❤️ Russell) guides the listener through the building’s history, while the listener makes their way from the 4th floor of the building towards the subway stop across the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of process, we started out by doing a session of sound recording throughout the building, before really knowing what topic we were going to focus on. We recorded a few samples of background noise on the ITP floor, elevator sounds, door sounds, footsteps, construction noise. While we ended up using very few of the samples recorded in this first session, it helped us get familiar with the recording equipment and explore the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;img-row-2&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2019-09-23-soundwalk-reflection/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Russell recording the wooden mirror&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we had a collection of the building’s environmental sounds, we split up and individually researched the history of the building (which has a pretty extensive &lt;a class=&quot;underlined&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/370_Jay_Street&quot; target=&quot;__blank&quot;&gt;Wikipedia entry&lt;/a&gt;.) The story we wanted to tell emerged from our conversations around the building’s history, and the fascination with the fact that both the MTA and ITP are truly dynamic entities, aiming to move people and ideas. We took it to the whiteboard in order to come up with a structure for the audio piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2019-09-23-soundwalk-reflection/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Whiteboard brainstorming session&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After deciding on the four main sections of the story (ITP, MTA, the dollar van and ITP again), we wrote a script and recorded Russell narrating it, using the ZOOM field recorder and a shotgun mic. The recording process was smooth—we captured two takes for each section, which proved to be more than enough during the editing phase. Nothing needed re-recording.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once recording the narration was complete, we cleaned up the audio files in Adobe Audition (mainly trimming and noise removal) and edited together the backbone of our sound walk—the narration from start to finish. During the editing phase, we kept going back and forth between researching sound effects and music tracks for different segments of our piece, and adjusting the timing of each chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After exporting our first rough cut, we started mapping the sound to the moving through space, and iterated on timing until the walking pace felt right. We were initially planning on having the walk start on the 4th floor of 370 Jay, go down in the subway station and end in the lobby of our building, but this was too ambitions: it would have taken way more than 5 minutes. We ended up reducing the scope of the walk—start on 4th floor, end outside the subwya stop—, and still had to stretch the audio content in order to account for slow walking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back on the process and outcome, I am happy with how our sound walk turned out. The collaboration felt natural, as we complemented each other well and brought different perspectives and skills to the table. One mistake I believe we’ve made is that we started thinking about mapping sound to the space very late in the process. Given that a sound walk is a site specific audio piece, I believe we should have considered movement way earlier during our ideation, instead of retro-fitting it on our first audio export. It would have also been a good idea to add more audio clues to signify the space one is in, and potentially have audio directions instead of written instructions.

Once regarded as a landmark of modernism in Brooklyn, the building fell into decay until 2012, when New York University acquired it, expanding its Brooklyn campus.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">LED Switch</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/09/17/led-switch.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="LED Switch" /><published>2019-09-17T13:38:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-09-17T13:38:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/09/17/led-switch</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/09/17/led-switch.html">&lt;p&gt;For our first physical computing lab, we were tasked with understanding and experimenting with basic circuit components, working on a solderless breadboard. This involved learning how to use a multimeter—for checking continuity or measuring resistance, voltage, and amperage—as well as creating a few basic circuits, involving a power supply, resistors and LEDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a next step, we introduced a switch into the circuit, while also playing with more LEDs, in series or in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;video class=&quot;img-row-2&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2019-09-17-led-switch/5.mov&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; muted=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Pressing the switch lights up the two LEDs.&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also introduced a potentiometer into the setup, as a way to manually adjust the resistance of the circuit and the voltage that gets to our LEDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;video src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2019-09-17-led-switch/7.mov&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; muted=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Turning the potentiometer's knob adjusts the brightness of the LEDs.&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last part of the assignment involved building a creative switch for our LEDs—one that is not neccesarily a push button, or an existing interface. I was interested in having the LEDs light up when a sound (or rather noise) event is happening, so I came up with this silly contraption. It uses conductive thread to attach the moving piece to the tilted metal rod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sound Walk Instructions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0:00—Begin on the 4th floor at 370 Jay Street in front of the Wooden Mirror;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0:13—Proceed to the right and then to the left through the glass doors, passing the ping pong table. Walk past the Equipment Room and the Shop, towards the kitchen. Take a right in the kitchen, and another right on the hallway. Then, walk down the hallway, towards the elevator bank;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2:10—Proceed down Stair D to your left down to the 1st floor;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3:05—Stop briefly at the “Transportation Building” plaque on the first floor;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3:20—Proceed to exit the building. Once outside of the building, cross the street towards Myrtle Ave. and stop at the MTA entrance. When you get there, turn around and look at 370 Jay. The soundwalk ends here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Curated by the Danish poet &lt;em&gt;Pejk Malinovski&lt;/em&gt; and narrated by filmmaker &lt;em&gt;Jim Jarmusch&lt;/em&gt;, the sound walk truly acts as a time portal to a less gentrified and more politically radical East Village, home to characters such as Allen Ginsberg, Patti Smith or The Velvet Underground. Having previously spent some time in the neighborhood, but never enough to know it intimately, the tour was a perfect opportunity to strenghten my friendship with the village’s streets and landmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The walk starts at the cross of E10th Street and 2nd Ave, in front of the St. Mark’s Church-In-The-Bowery—one of the oldest religious sites in the city, also a culture hub of the neighborhood since the beginning of the 1900s. Poets would host readings here and politically progressive groups would gather in this space, and I find it beautiful that one of the oldest places in the city, especially one associated with religious practice, opened its doors to the local creatives, misfits, punks and to the opressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We proceed north on 2nd Ave then head east on East 12th Street, while learning about the opera influences in Walt Whitman’s poetry, passing Allen Ginsberg’s old apartment at 437 East 12th, and becoming familiar with Jon Giorno’s &lt;em&gt;Dial-a-poem&lt;/em&gt; project. I want to stop here for a second, as this is an incredible work of early new media art, which uses a few telephones and a few tape players as a means to making poetry accessible to a wide audience, while creating a radical space and sharing it with the world. MoMA and The New Museum have included &lt;em&gt;Dial-a-poem&lt;/em&gt; in a few shows recently, meaning that there is at least one active phone number that is running the project. Try it yourself: 641-793-8122.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of structure, the audio tour is split up into 30 different locations, each accompanied by a short episode. Every episode is a montage of narration which gives historical and political context, old recordings of poetry readings, interviews and music. There isn’t much in terms of sound effects or a rich soundtrack to accompany the voices speaking to us—that role is left open for Lower East Side’s streets live soundscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/2019-09-08-passing-stranger/frank_ohara.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Plaque at Frank O'Hara's old apartment at 441 East 9th Street&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

    Image description: A bronze plaque on the building where Frank O'Hara used to live. The text reads: &lt;em&gt;Frank O'Hara (1926—1966). The influential American poet Frank O'Hara lived at 441 East 9th Street from 1959 to 1963. O'Hara was a leading member of the New York School of poetry as well as an accomplished art critic and curator at the Museum of Modern Art. Downtown people and places figure prominently in his buoyant books, especially his circle of noted writers and painters who have been called &quot;the last avant garde&quot;. Placed by the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation with the generous support of the Two Boots Foundation.&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, in addition to the beautifully curated content, it felt refreshing to participate in this “mixed reality” experience in a low-tech way—with simple earbuds, which allowed for the street sounds to merge with Jim Jarmusch’s narration, without a computerized GPS voice in my ears suggesting when to turn left and right, or without an augmented reality layer to bring the space to life, digitally. The audio was truly engaging, and the necessity of being proactive in finding my way to the different locations contributed to the sense that I am discovering a new place and a new time.&lt;/p&gt;
