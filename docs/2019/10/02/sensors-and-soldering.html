    <div class="blog-post-content">
        <p>This week’s physical computing labs involved working with analog input and output for the Arduino, as well as soldering. Since we’re having a review week, I chose to focus on two things:</p>

<p>1) Improving the <a class="underlined" href="/2019/09/25/technology-observation.html">LED sequencer I built for the previous lab;<a></a></a></p>

<p>and</p>

<p>2) Getting outside of the breadboard and working with resin, a material I’ve wanted to experiment with for some time.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>Sequencer 2.0</strong></p>

<p>To recap, last week the sequencer used 3 steps—3 LEDs, each blinking when the current step is playing a note, and 3 potentiometers, used to adjust the frequency of the note played at each step. It also included a 4th potentiometer which controlled the perceived “speed” of the sequencer—how much time is spent playing the note at each step. This week’s improvements included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>soldering the speaker connecting wires, which were previously attached to the speaker using alligator clips;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>adding a 4th step to the sequencer, in order to play slightly more complex sequences; ideally, we would have 8 or 16 steps, but real estate is limited on the breadboard;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>adding another control input to the sequencer in the form of a photoresistor; this allows for controlling the overall pitch of the played sequence by covering or uncovering the sensor with one’s hand;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>improving the software such that the Arduino <code class="highlighter-rouge">loop</code> cycle is not dependent on the speed of the sequencer anymore; this means that frequency of a step’s sound can now be adjusted while the step is playing;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>experimenting with different sensitivity levels for the photoresistor reading (I ended up settling on dividing the output into 8 different buckets, since the sensor readings were quite noisy.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the photoresistor in action:</p>

<p>While I was initially going for the theremin <em>continous bending</em> sound quality, I realized that was going to be difficult for two main reasons: the noise in the photoresistor reading (even when averaged over time) and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">loop</code> function timing trade-offs between <code class="highlighter-rouge">tone</code> working properly and proper responsivity. So I went a different direction and started working with only discrete quantities. As mentioned before, I divided the photoresistor output into only roughly 8 different buckets. In terms of the frequencies that get played by the sequencer, they all full octaves apart and have the C pitch (the step frequencies get rounded to multiples of 65.) This produces an effect similar to a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=quantizer" target="__blank" class="underlined">quantizer</a>.</p>

<p>Here are two more videos of playing the sequencer. The noise in the photoresistor adds an improvised quality to the sound, which I find enjoyable.</p>
