    Amidst the hum of the turbines, a quiet picnic unfolds by the river / <br/> 
    A hydropower plant, once a monument to the raw power of (human) technology, now transformed into a site of leisure / <br/> 
    Here, a multitude of life forms converge, re-kindling a once disrupted ecosystem.<br/><br/>
    “World Upstream” is an upcoming real-time simulation centering the relationship between built infrastructure and the “natural” landscape, through the perspective of an emergent, more-than-human community reclaiming the site of a decaying dam. <em>Work in progress</em>. <br/><br/>
