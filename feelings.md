     In late 2018 I decided to change my programming career in the tech world for one in the arts. I soon learned that working as an artist involves writing countless proposals – for grants, residencies, shows, and so on. I am keeping track of all my art related applications in a Google Sheet, which is publicly shared below. <br/><br/>
     The groups, organizations and institutions reviewing these submissions are rarely transparent about their processes, and almost never give reasons for their decisions. I'm making my list public because I believe there should be more institutional – and in equal parts individual – transparency around this topic.
