     000pen.space is a drawing tool on an infinite canvas, under a set of rigid design constraints. Started as an investigation on grids with p5.js, it has evolved into a personal diary of sorts, containing text, images, and various visual compositions made out of lines and rectangles. The data on canvas is sparse and almost impossible to navigate, adding a layer of anonymity to the site.<br/><br/>
