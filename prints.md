    These works are all created using code, Javascript with the canvas-sketch library, and printed using an Axidraw V3 pen plotter. Given the highly mechanical nature of pen plotting, no two prints are identical, even if they are created from the same digital file, factors such as paper texture, pen wear or ink levels introduce slight variations in each piece.<br/><br/>
    A few of them were featured in <a href="https://vetroeditions.com/products/tracing-the-line" target="_blank">Tracing the Line</a>, a 2023 publication featuring 11 pioneers and 100 contemporary artists working with drawing machines.
