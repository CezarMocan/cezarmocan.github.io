     <a class="underlined" href="http://www.gakko.org" target="__blank">Gakko</a> is a global educational collective that builds spaces, experiences & tools that reclaim the magic of learning. Every summer, Gakko Camps are held in beautiful places around the world. Designed from the ground up by a diverse group of mentors, Gakko Camps emphasize interdisciplinary workshops and global mentorship.

     Each year, we encourage attendees to document their own personal experiences at camp using photography and the visual arts. The gallery is the result.
