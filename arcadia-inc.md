    Arcadia Inc. is a work of speculative fiction which investigates the commodification of nature through computer-generated landscape photography. In observing context erasure as the main mechanism behind re-programming images with new meanings, the work proposes a new model for obtaining the type of nature imagery meant for brand-based visual communication: a group of virtual beings which photograph scenic beauty in a real-time simulation, organized as a fictional company which produces stock images of natural environments. In an era when visual culture is created increasingly through technological automation, the work raises important questions about the future of image making.<br/><br/>

#     A previous framing of the project involved a fictional company which claims to offer "context-free landscape photography for the 21st century user".
