    Soft Power (Arcadia Inc.) is a work of speculative fiction which responds to the use of landscape photography as a carrier for brand ideologies, on the computer desktop and beyond. The piece proposes the synthetic landscape as a clean, context-free alternative to nature imagery, through a group of virtual beings which photograph nature 24/7 in a real-time simulation.<br/><br/>

    Soft Power (Arcadia Inc.) was part of <a href="https://www.springbreakartshow.com/" target="_blank">SPRING/BREAK Art Show</a> in New York, as a <a href="https://springbreakartfair.com/collections/lizzy-chiappini-2021" target="_blank">solo show</a> curated by <a href="https://www.lizzy-chiappini.com/" target="_blank">Lizzy Chiappini</a>. For the duration of SPRING/BREAK, all photographs taken by virtual beings within the simulation were uploaded to <a href="https://soft-power.online" target="_blank">https://soft-power.online.</a><br/><br/>

    A previous framing of the project involved a fictional company which claims to offer "context-free landscape photography for the 21st century user". You can learn more about Arcadia Inc. as a company by visiting <a href="http://arcadia-inc.org" target="_blank">http://arcadia-inc.org</a>, or by listening to my <a href="https://vimeo.com/549761951" target="_blank">thesis presentation</a>.<br/><br/>
