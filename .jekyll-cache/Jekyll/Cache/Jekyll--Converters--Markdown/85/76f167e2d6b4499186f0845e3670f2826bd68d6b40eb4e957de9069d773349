I"t<p>Upon doing a round of research for communication protocols in the wild, as well as a few personal interests (<em>FM radio</em>, which I had done a project with last semester, <em>telnet</em> which is so old but still around or the <em>Spanning Tree Protocol</em>, an early network routing protocol developed by a woman pioneer of computer science, Radia Perlman) I ended choosing <em>FTP</em>, the File Transfer Protocol. I chose it mostly for nostalgic reasons. When I started using the internet in the early 2000s, I used to encounter sites served over ftp:// relatively often. Their visibility (and numbers) have been diminishing since, to the point where it took me about a reasonable amount of research in order to simply find one today. As the internet evolves, FTP will likely remain relevant for historical purposes, but its practical uses will be completely obsolete.</p>
