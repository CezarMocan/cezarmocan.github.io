I"6	<p>Doing a 3D scan proved to be a lot of fun, my partner and I scanned each other a few times (and also considered scanning Lentil the cat, but quickly gave up on that :) ). However the results did not turn out great, mostly due to my being stubborn in deciding to use a Microsoft Kinect 2 (the XBox One version) I own, instead of a structure sensor from the ER.</p>

<p>It turns out the Skanect software developers had decided not to implement support for this version of the Kinect, due to its poor results in scanning. I ended up using the default Windows 3D Scan app, which worked well. My scan’s mesh turned out fine – low-ish resolution, but not bad overall, and it can probably be smoothed out a bit in Maya. However, the texture has a large amount of visual glitches all over the place, aside from the poor image quality (which I was expecting.)</p>

<p>I’m not quite sure whether the texture quality is a matter of hardware or software, but I assume it’s something I could entirely avoid by using equipment from the ER. I might do that this coming week, in order to work with a higher quality scan of myself.</p>

<p>However, I find the texture file (glitchy as it is) to be quite gorgeous!</p>
