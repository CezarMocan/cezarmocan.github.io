<p>This weekâ€™s physical computing labs involved working with analog input and output for the Arduino, as well as soldering. Since weâ€™re having a review week, I chose to focus on two things: 1) Improving the <a class="underlined" href="/2019/09/25/technology-observation.html">LED sequencer I built for the previous lab;</a> and 2) Getting outside of the breadboard and working with resin, a material Iâ€™ve wanted to experiment with for some time.</p>
