I"4<p>I ended up starting this week’s assignment by re-doing my 3D scan, since the one I had done with a Kinect v2 last week turned out quite poor – decent mesh, but horrible textures. Bellus3D turned out much better, the texture resolution is high and the mesh has a lot of detail. There are still a few glitches – the texture on the nose looks stretched, there is no gap behind the ears, and most visibly the texture on the top &amp; back of the head is inferred, rather than captured (the app only scans the front &amp; side of your head, not the back.)</p>
