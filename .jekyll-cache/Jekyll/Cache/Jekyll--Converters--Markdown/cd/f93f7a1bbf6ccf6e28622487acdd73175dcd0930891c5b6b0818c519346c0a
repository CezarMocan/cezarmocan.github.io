<p>For the physical computing midterm project I worked in collaboration with Keunjung Bae. The assignment was Halloween themed, so we decided to build a device that allows one to search for the spirits stuck between worlds. Inspired by technology used by the ghost hunting communities (namely <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Ghost_box" target="__blanl" class="underlined">ghost boxes</a>,) we came up with our own interface for finding ghosts.</p>
