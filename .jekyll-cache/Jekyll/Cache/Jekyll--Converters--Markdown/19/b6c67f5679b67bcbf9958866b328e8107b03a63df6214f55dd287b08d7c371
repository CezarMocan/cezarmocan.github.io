I"Ü<p>After taking footage at arbitrary locations through the city and in my apartment over the past week, I realized Iâ€™ve been shooting things similar to what I am always attracted to. With a few exceptions, all the videos seem fit into one of these broad categories: <em>linear motion</em> (e.g. pointing the camera out the window of a train or car), <em>water</em>, <em>circular motion</em> (e.g. a record player) and <em>landscape</em>.</p>

<p>This realization made me revisit the history of videos on my phone, since December 2016, and pick the ones that roughly fit these themes as a way of building a larger library. I came up with a few other categories (<em>eyes</em>, <em>flickers</em>, <em>forward motion</em>) and clustered together clips from videos belonging to three of the themes: <em>linear motion</em>, <em>water</em> and <em>landscape</em>. Below are the results. I didnâ€™t take the time to cluster the other ones together, but I will likely be using them throughout the class.</p>

<p>I can make the library of footage available on Dropbox or Google Drive as well if needed.</p>
