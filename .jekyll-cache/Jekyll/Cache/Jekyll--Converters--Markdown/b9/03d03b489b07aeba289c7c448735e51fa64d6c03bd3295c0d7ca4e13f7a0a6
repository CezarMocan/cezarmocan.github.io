I"·<p>The sixth and last <a class="underlined" target="__blank" href="https://itp.nyu.edu/fab/">fabrication</a> assignment focuses on motors. I came back to my series of <a href="/2019/10/30/flashlight.html" class="underlined">absurd</a> and <a href="/2019/11/05/usb-flash-drives.html">user</a> <a href="/2019/11/26/music-box.html">unfriendly</a> objects and made a clock that only shows the passing of time, without giving you the exact hour.</p>

<p>I first purchased a <a href="https://www.michaels.com/0.75in-clock-movement-kit-with-black-hands-by-artminds/10475425.html?cm_mmc=PLASearch-_-google-_-MICH_Shopping_US_N_Crafts%26Hobbies_N_N_N_N-_-Crafts+%26+Hobbies&amp;Kenshoo_ida=&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAis3vBRBdEiwAHXB29EceWt5qwmsd495G-SiJQBzQJLVVw-US9oblMWzHcWg3iIMIiosnxxoCgCcQAvD_BwE" target="__blank">clock movement kit</a> from Michaelâ€™s.</p>

<p>I was pretty set on making a wooden clock, but at the same time found myself under time pressure (get it?!? is that why I decided to build a clock?!? ðŸ¤¯ is this project a Freudian slip?!? ðŸ¤¯), so the decision came down between appropriating an older Fab project, or using something off the junk shelf. The junk shelf had a broken down wooden wind chime which I looked promising (no photo unfortunatelyâ€¦,) but I ended up choosing to turn my <a href="/2019/11/12/one-pencil-holder.html" target="__blank">Fab #3 assignment</a>, the pencil holder, into a clock. You can read that blog post for details on how the wooden spiral was built.</p>

<p>Fabricating this project was quite simpleâ€”it involved opening up the wooden spiral, placing the clock mechanism inside, drilling a hole of the right size through the spiralâ€™s bottom, re-glueing the spiral, laser-cutting the acrylic sheet and sanding its edges. I tried glueing the clock to the acrylic, but I did not have the appropriate glue for it, and a few experiments (with acrylic cement, general purpose glue and wood glue) all failed.</p>

<p>In retrospect, this project was really fun to build. However, I wish I had more time to dedicate to its fabrication. On the positive side, it definitely made me appreciate clocks and to the point where I want to build a larger clock project in the near future.</p>
