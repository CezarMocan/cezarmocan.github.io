<p>For this week’s assignment, I revisited my understanding of skeletal meshes and working with them in Unreal Engine, through Matt’s tutorials. I became familiar with this type of mesh last semester, through work I did for Synthetic Architectures and for my Live Image Processing &amp; Performance final project.</p>
