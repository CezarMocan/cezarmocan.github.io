I"o<p>Doing a 3D scan proved to be a lot of fun, my partner and I scanned each other a few times (and also considered scanning Lentil the cat, but quickly gave up on that :) ). However the results did not turn out great, mostly due to my being stubborn in deciding to use a Microsoft Kinect 2 (the XBox One version) I own, instead of a structure sensor from the ER.</p>
