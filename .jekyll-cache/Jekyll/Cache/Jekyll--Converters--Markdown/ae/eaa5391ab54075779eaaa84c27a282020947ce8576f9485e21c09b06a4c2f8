<p>The third <a class="underlined" target="__blank" href="https://itp.nyu.edu/fab/">fabrication</a> assignment focuses on measuring tools and using the laser cutter. I continued my series of <a href="/2019/10/30/flashlight.html" class="underlined">absurd</a> and <a href="/2019/11/05/usb-flash-drives.html">user unfriendly</a> objects and made a pencil holder that holds exactly one pencil.</p>

<p>Part of the reason why I chose to build this project is the fact that I only own one pen(cil) at a time, since it makes me accountable to not losing it. The current one happens to be a <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Stabilo-Point-88-Fineliner-Marker-Pen-0.4-mm-Black/pd/7324?gclid=CjwKCAiAzanuBRAZEiwA5yf4ulMyb38VydmBINMm_CowvCKrpts-Z9aYvBMjs8Fpr5MAssoTm0o4PxoCr44QAvD_BwE" target="__blank" class="underlined">Stabilo Point 88</a>. I measured it and decided that a reasonable height for the holder would be 5in. Having worked with the laser cutter and acrylic before, I decided to be economical with my materials, and used a pre-owned 1/8in thick sheet of plywood. Going further down the economy rabbit hole, I came up with a design that would waste very little material: concentric circles, stacked on top of each other.</p>

<p>The figure shows 40 circles (the amount needed in order to achieve a height of 5in when stacking them on top of each other,) as well as a spiral-looking patternâ€”every layer got marked with the point where it should be aligned with the previous and next layers, in order to create a 3-dimensional spiral upon stacking.</p>
