I"¼<p>After taking footage at arbitrary locations through the city and in my apartment over the past week, I realized Iâ€™ve been shooting things similar to what I am always attracted to. With a few exceptions, all the videos seem fit into one of these broad categories: <em>linear motion</em> (e.g. pointing the camera out the window of a train or car), <em>water</em>, <em>circular motion</em> (e.g. a record player) and <em>landscape</em>.</p>
