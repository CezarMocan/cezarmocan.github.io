I"4<p>The fifth <a class="underlined" target="__blank" href="https://itp.nyu.edu/fab/">fabrication</a> assignment focuses on materials and fasteners. This time, I diverged from my series of <a href="/2019/10/30/flashlight.html" class="underlined">absurd</a> and <a href="/2019/11/05/usb-flash-drives.html">user</a> <a href="/2019/11/26/music-box.html">unfriendly</a> objects and made a mold of my hand using resin, watercolor and a handful of USB heads. I had been excited about experimenting with resin for a while, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity.</p>
