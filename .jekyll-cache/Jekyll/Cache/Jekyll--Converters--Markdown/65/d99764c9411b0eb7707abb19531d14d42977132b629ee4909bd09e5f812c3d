I"‡<p>I am an artist and programmer, born in Romania and working in Brooklyn. I am interested in studying with the power structures that shape societyâ€™s engagement with technology. I work with software, video and computer generated imagery towards recontextualizing aspects of digital culture we take for granted, often in absurd ways. My practice at large investigates the role branding and Silicon Valley discourse have in shaping contemporary ideologies. Most recently, I have been researching the computer desktopâ€™s use of nature photography through the lens of landscape studies.
<br /><br />
Besides my personal work, I often design or build software for other artists and teach. I am currently a Research Resident at NYU ITP, and hold an M.P.S. in Interactive Telecommunications from NYU ITP, and a B.A. in Computer Science from Yale University.
<br /><br />
In a former life, I used to do competitive programming.

<p style="text-decoration: none;">Artist Statement</p>
<p><br />
I am a Romanian new media artist based in Brooklyn, working with video, installation and software as a means of understanding and recontextualizing the spaces between humans and computers. The work I do involves the creation of humane digital environments that juxtapose elements native to our computers with organic entities rooted in the physical reality. My practice at large raises questions around existing patterns of engaging with technology and proposes slower, more intimate alternatives. In these pursuits, I am inspired by Mikka Rottenberg and Olia Lialina, whose video and web based work engages with identity and representation through elements of ritual and fiction. 
<br /><br />
In my process I often refer back to algorithms and data structures, which I developed a close relationship with throughout years of practicing competitive programming and working in the software industry. What had initially started as a technical pursuit, with efficiency as the only goal, slowly became grounded in reality and acquired an increasing human dimension. I find joy in bringing entities which are infinitely scalable and replicable into a personal realm.
<br /><br />
The work I do is also influenced by my experience as an immigrant in the United States. I am interested in the implications of being part of a diaspora from a social and cultural point of view, as well as understanding how geographical displacement influences digital identity.</p>
