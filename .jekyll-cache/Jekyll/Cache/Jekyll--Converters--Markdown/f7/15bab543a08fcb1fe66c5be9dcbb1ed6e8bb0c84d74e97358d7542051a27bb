I"v<p>For our first physical computing lab, we were tasked with understanding and experimenting with basic circuit components, working on a solderless breadboard. This involved learning how to use a multimeter—for checking continuity or measuring resistance, voltage, and amperage—as well as creating a few basic circuits, involving a power supply, resistors and LEDs.</p>
