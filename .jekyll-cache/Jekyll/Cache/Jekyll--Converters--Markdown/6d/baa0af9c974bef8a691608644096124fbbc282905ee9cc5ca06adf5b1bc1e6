I"U<p>In my <a href="">previous post</a> I proposed two possible directions for the final project. One involved an interactive video frame on a 7” screen, and the other one was a virtual road trip using Google Street View imagery on a smaller, 2.8” screen. I chose the second direction due to lack of access to video equipment and delays in shipping electronic components during this period.</p>
