<p>My first part of the assignment involved finishing the ATTiny85 programming jig, since I hadnâ€™t got too far in classâ€”only one pin was soldered. While the process felt somewhat tedious, it went smoothly. I checked for shorts between any two pins using a potentiometer and found none. I followed the <a href="http://homemadehardware.com/guides/programming-an-attiny85/">programming tutorial on the class website</a> in order to burn the ATTinyâ€™s bootloader and upload my own sketch. Surprisingly, everything worked from the first attempt. I ended up adding an LED to the jig and connecting it to the ATTinyâ€™s digital pin 3, as a way of improving the jigâ€™s functionality to testing, in addition to programming.</p>
