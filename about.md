I am an artist and programmer, born in Romania and working in Brooklyn. I am interested in studying the power structures that shape society’s engagement with technology. I work with software, video and computer generated imagery towards recontextualizing aspects of digital culture we take for granted, often in absurd ways. My practice at large investigates the role branding and Silicon Valley discourse have in shaping contemporary ideologies. Most recently, I have been researching the computer desktop’s use of nature photography through the lens of landscape studies.
<br/><br/>
Besides my personal work, I often design or build software for other artists and teach. I am currently a Research Resident at NYU ITP, and hold an M.P.S. in Interactive Telecommunications from NYU ITP and a B.S. in Computer Science from Yale University.
<br/><br/>
In a former life, I used to do competitive programming.

<div class="about-container">
I am an artist and programmer, interested in expressions of intimacy in the digital realm. I consider the web to be my primary medium, but I have also worked with mobile applications, game engines, physical computing, augmented reality or print graphic design.

<br/><br/>

In a former life, I used to do competitive programming.

<br/><br/>

More recently, I have been designing or developing software for artists such as <a class="underlined" href="http://www.evan-roth.com/" target="__blank">Evan Roth</a> and <a class="underlined" href="http://taeyoonchoi.com/" target="__blank">Taeyoon Choi</a>. I have also been involved with two start-ups in the education world, <a class="underlined" href="https://www.fablestudios.com" target="__blank">Fable Studios</a> and <a class="underlined" href="https://www.gakko.org" target="__blank">Gakko</a>. 

<br/><br/>

I am currently pursuing a two-year long masters program at <a class="underlined" href="https://itp.nyu.edu" target="__blank">NYU ITP</a> and keeping a <a class="underlined" href="/blog" target="__blank">blog</a> about it.

<br/><br/>
