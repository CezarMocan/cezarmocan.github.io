<div class="c6">
I am an artist and programmer, interested in expressions of intimacy in the digital realm. I consider the web to be my primary medium, but I have also worked with mobile applications, game engines, physical computing, augmented reality or print graphic design.

<br/><br/>

In a former life, I used to do competitive programming.

<br/><br/>

More recently, I have been designing or developing software for artists such as <a class="underlined" href="http://www.evan-roth.com/" target="__blank">Evan Roth</a> and <a class="underlined" href="http://taeyoonchoi.com/" target="__blank">Taeyoon Choi</a>. I have also been involved with two start-ups in the education world, <a class="underlined" href="https://www.fablestudios.com" target="__blank">Fable Studios</a> and <a class="underlined" href="https://www.gakko.org" target="__blank">Gakko</a>.

<br/><br/>

I am currently pursuing a two-year long masters program at <a class="underlined" href="https://itp.nyu.edu" target="__blank">NYU ITP</a> and keeping a <a class="underlined" href="/blog" target="__blank">blog</a> about it.

<br/><br/>
