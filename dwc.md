     In 2019, <a class="underlined" href="http://taeyoonchoi.com/" target="_blank">Taeyoon Choi</a> organized a lecture-performance at the Whitney Museum of American Art, as part of his ongoing <a href="http://distributedweb.care/" target="_blank" class="underlined">Distributed Web of Care</a> project. I was invited to create a mobile-based web experience for the participants, using the garden as a metaphor for the web, in collaboration with <a class="underlined" href="http://yhsong.com/" target="_blank">Yehwan Song</a> and <a class="underlined" href="https://jedahan.com/" target="_blank">Jonathan Dahan</a>.<br/><br/>

     We landed on a design that incorporated representations of nature from Taeyoon's paintings, as well as a series of creatures, the inhabitants of the our networked garden, which walked from one participant to another. <br/><br/>
